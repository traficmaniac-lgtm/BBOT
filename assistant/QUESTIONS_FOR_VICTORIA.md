# QUESTIONS
- Should we prioritize full websocket streaming for the active pair (bookTicker/miniTicker) in the trading panel, or keep REST snapshot refresh?
- Any specific fee-free symbols we should whitelist manually until Binance exposes an explicit API flag?
- Do we need persistence for saved profiles in the new trading panel (profiles/*.yaml) immediately, or plan for next iteration?
